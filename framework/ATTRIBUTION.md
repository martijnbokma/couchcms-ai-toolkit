# The Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework - Attribution & Sync

## Original Work

This framework is based on the **Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework (AAPF)** by **aashari**.

**Original Source**: https://gist.github.com/aashari/07cc9c1b6c0debbeb4f4d94a3a81339e

The framework provides a disciplined, evidence-first prompting system designed to elevate AI agents from simple command executors to autonomous principal engineers.
