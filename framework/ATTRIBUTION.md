# The Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework - Attribution & Sync

## Original Work

This framework is based on the **Autonomous Agent Prompting Framework (AAPF)** by **aashari**.

**Original Source**: https://gist.github.com/aashari/07cc9c1b6c0debbeb4f4d94a3a81339e

The framework provides a disciplined, evidence-first prompting system designed to elevate AI agents from simple command executors to autonomous principal engineers.

## Credits

**Author**: aashari
**Original Publication**: GitHub Gist
**Framework Version**: Based on original gist (check source for latest version)

## Philosophy

The AAPF framework embodies five foundational principles:

1. **Research-First, Always** - Never act on assumption
2. **Extreme Ownership** - End-to-end system responsibility
3. **Autonomous Problem-Solving** - Self-sufficient with minimal escalation
4. **Unyielding Precision & Safety** - Respect for operational environment
5. **Metacognitive Self-Improvement** - Systematic learning and evolution

### Claude Code Infrastructure Patterns

**diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase** - https://github.com/diet103/claude-code-infrastructure-showcase

This repository provided valuable inspiration for:

- **Skill auto-activation patterns** - Hooks-based skill triggering
- **Modular skill structure** - Progressive disclosure with resource files
- **Production-tested patterns** - Real-world patterns from 6 months of use
- **Dev docs system** - Context preservation across resets

**Note**: While this toolkit uses different patterns (modules/agents vs skills), the underlying principles of auto-activation, modular structure, and production-tested patterns were influential in the toolkit's design.
