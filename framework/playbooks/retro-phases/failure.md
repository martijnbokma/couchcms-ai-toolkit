# Phase 2: Failure Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze failures and identify root causes.

---

## Failure Patterns

**For each failure:**

```markdown
## Failure: {Name}

**What went wrong:**
{Description of the failure}

**User correction:**
{How the issue was identified}

**Root cause:**
{Why it happened - be specific}

**Lesson:**
{What should be done differently}

**Prevention:**
{How to prevent in future}
```

---

## Correction Patterns

**How failures were corrected:**

```markdown
- **{Correction Pattern}:** {Description}
  - Original approach: {What was tried}
  - Corrected approach: {What worked}
  - Why it worked: {Explanation}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns Identified

**Patterns to avoid:**

```markdown
❌ **{Anti-Pattern Name}**
- What it is: {Description}
- Why it fails: {Explanation}
- Better approach: {Alternative}
```

---

## Root Cause Categories

```markdown
**Technical:**
- {Root cause 1}

**Process:**
- {Root cause 2}

**Communication:**
- {Root cause 3}

**Assumptions:**
- {Root cause 4}
```
