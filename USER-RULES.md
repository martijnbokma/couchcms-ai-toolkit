## Communication Style

Please reply in a concise style. Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler language.

When explaining code:
- Be direct and to the point
- Use examples when helpful
- Skip obvious explanations

## Code Preferences

- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Favor immutability over mutation
- Always use explicit types (no 'any' in TypeScript)
- Prefer named exports over default exports

## Language Requirements

- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

## Workflow

- Always ask for confirmation before making breaking changes
- Suggest improvements but don't implement without approval
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Provide alternatives when possible

## CouchCMS-Specific Preferences

When working with CouchCMS:
- Always use `<cms:embed>` for shared components
- Use authentication filters for protected content
- Follow CouchCMS security best practices
- Never use `<cms:` tags in HTML comments (use `[cms:` instead)

## Notes

- User Rules apply to **Agent (Chat)** only, not Inline Edit
- User Rules are global and apply to all projects
- For project-specific rules, use Project Rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- User Rules have lowest precedence: Team Rules → Project Rules → User Rules
