# Project Rules Template

Use this template to create custom Project Rules for your project.

## How to Use

1. Create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Copy the template below
3. Customize for your project
4. Rules are automatically loaded by Cursor

## Template

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does
globs: ['**/*.html', '**/*.php']
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Title

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies when:
- Working with files matching: `**/*.html`, `**/*.php`
- [Add other conditions]

## Instructions

When this rule is active:

1. **First principle**
   - Specific instruction
   - Example or pattern

2. **Second principle**
   - Specific instruction
   - Example or pattern

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example

```html
<!-- Example of correct usage -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">Content</div>
</div>
```

### ❌ Bad Example

```html
<!-- Example of incorrect usage -->
<div style="background: white;">Content</div>
```

## Integration

This rule works with:
- [Related rules or modules]
- [Related agents or workflows]

## Notes

- [Additional context or warnings]
- [References to documentation]
```

## Rule Types

### Always Apply Rule

```yaml
---
description: Always active rule
alwaysApply: true
---

# Rule Content

This rule is always active regardless of file selection.
```

### File-Specific Rule

```yaml
---
description: Rule for specific file types
globs: ['snippets/components/**/*.html']
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Content

This rule applies when working with component files.
```

### Intelligent Rule

```yaml
---
description: Clear description helps Cursor apply intelligently
globs: ['**/*.ts']
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Content

This rule is applied when Cursor determines it's relevant.
```

### Manual Rule

Create a `.md` file (not `.mdc`) for manual triggers:

```markdown
# Manual Rule

This rule is invoked with @rule-name in chat.
```

## Path Variables

Use these variables for portable rules:

- `snippets` - Snippets directory
- `assets/ts` - TypeScript files
- `assets/js` - JavaScript files
- `assets/css` - CSS files
- `snippets/forms` - Form files
- `snippets/views` - View files
- `snippets/filters` - Filter files
- `snippets/components` - Component files
- `snippets/layouts` - Layout files
- `public` - Public directory

## Best Practices

1. **Keep rules focused** - One rule per concern
2. **Use clear descriptions** - Helps intelligent application
3. **Test glob patterns** - Verify they match the right files
4. **Use path variables** - Make rules portable
5. **Keep under 500 lines** - Split large rules into multiple

## Examples

### Example 1: Component Rule

```yaml
---
description: Component structure and patterns
globs: ['snippets/components/**/*.html']
alwaysApply: false
---

# Component Rules

When creating or refactoring components:

- Use semantic HTML5
- Include accessibility attributes
- Follow daisyUI component patterns
- Keep components under 100 lines
```

### Example 2: Form Rule

```yaml
---
description: Form validation and security
globs: ['snippets/forms/**/*.html']
alwaysApply: false
---

# Form Rules

When working with forms:

- Always include CSRF protection
- Validate on both client and server
- Use DataBound Forms patterns
- Include error handling
```

### Example 3: TypeScript Rule

```yaml
---
description: TypeScript type safety and patterns
globs: ['assets/ts/**/*.ts']
alwaysApply: false
---

# TypeScript Rules

When writing TypeScript:

- Always use explicit return types
- Avoid 'any' type
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer type unions over enums
```
